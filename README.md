Manage your server with a single php script file

- use layui and jquery

- Cdnjs.com provides acceleration

- Note that the git committer "HarukaMa" added "root@vultr.guest" to his account by using github's behavior of not verifying the email address. Submissions made by accounts without mail settings will be associated with this user "HarukaMa". It's a very annoying behavior.

- If your git-config doesn't modify the email address, then I suggest you modify it to your own.
